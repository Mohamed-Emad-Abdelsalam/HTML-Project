<h1 style="color:blue"> <center> Examples of Operating Systems </center> </h1>


<p> Laptops, tablets, desktop computers, smartphones, and servers all run operating systems. There are three main operating systems for computers: 
Windows, Apple, and Linux. The two main operating systems for mobile are Android and iOS. There are countless other operating systems made 
for specific devices, such as Samsung's One UI that only works on Samsung devices.

<br> <br>

The following are some of the most popular and common operating systems worldwide. </p> 

<br> 

<h1 style="color:green"> <center> Microsoft Windows </center> </h1>

<p> Microsoft Windows has existed in one form or another since 1985, and it remains the most popular operating system for home and office computers. 
Its latest versions, including Windows 10, are also used on some tablets, and the OS is used on some web and number-crunching server computers 
as well. Computers from a wide variety of manufacturers can use Windows. </p>

<br>

<h1 style="color:green"> <center> macOS </center> </h1>

<p> Head-to-head in the competition with Microsoft Windows is Apple’s macOS. macOS and Windows are both examples of proprietary operating systems, 
meaning that the company conceptualized, designed, developed, and now sells their own OS. They’re designed and sold by the companies and aren’t 
meant to be tampered with or tweaked by users. Apple and Macintosh computers run on the proprietary macOS and OS X system, the first of which 
launched 20 years ago. </p>

<h1 style="color:green"> <center> Linux </center> </h1>

<p> Linux is a free, open source operating system. Anyone can run, study, modify, and redistribute the source code, or even sell copies of their 
modified code, as long as they do so under the same license. Because of this, Linux has become the largest open sources software project in 
the world. Professional and hobbyist programmers from around the world contribute to the Linux operating system, adding features, finding and 
fixing bugs and security flaws, and providing new ideas—all while sharing their contributions back to the community. </p>

<br>

<h1 style="color:green"> <center> Android & iOS </center> </h1>

<p> Google's Android and Apple's iOS are operating systems used primarily in mobile technology, such as smartphones and tablets. Android, which is 
Linux-based and partly open source, is more PC-like than iOS, in that its interface and basic features are generally more customizable from top 
to bottom. However, iOS' uniform design elements are sometimes seen as being more user-friendly. </p>
